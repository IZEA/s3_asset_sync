= S3 Asset Sync

This gem provides a simple way of synchronizing your Rails 4/5 assets with an AWS S3 Bucket.

== Installation

  Add it to your gemfile!

  ```
  gem 's3_asset_sync', git: "https://github.com/IZEA/s3_asset_sync"
  ```


== Configuration

Run the following command to generate a configuration file in your Rails /config/initializers folder.

  rake s3_asset_sync:setup

Edit that file and replace the default values with your own AWS details.

== Usage

By default, assets will be synchronized automatically after precompilation:

  rake assets:precompile

If this is not the desired behavior then simply edit the configuration value as below:

 Rails.application.config.s3_asset_sync.run_after_precompile = false

To manually synchronize assets run:

  rake assets:sync_to_s3

== Deleting Assets

Expired assets won't be automatically removed from S3 as some nodes within a load balanced setup may temporarily require older assets. To delete expired assets from S3 run:

  rake assets:purge_s3
